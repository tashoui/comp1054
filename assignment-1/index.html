                    <p>Cultivate your hunger before you idealize</p>
                    <p>Motivate your anger to make them all realize</p>
                    <p>Climbing the mountain, never coming down</p>

                    <p>Sneaking out the classroom by the back door</p>
                    <p>A man railed at me twice, though, but I didn't care</p>
                    <p>Waiting is wasting for people like me</p>
